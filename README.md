## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I learned to adopt a **mobile-first** approach to styling and how to manage responsiveness using **media queries** instead of relying on CSS functions like `clamp()`. This allowed for a more controlled layout transition between mobile and desktop. I also focused on **hover states** for interactive elements, ensuring a good user experience across devices.

Hereâ€™s an example of the media query I used for larger screens:

```css
@media (min-width: 768px) {
    .card-profile { 
        max-width: 384px;
        padding: var(--pad-desktop);
    }
}
```
